    <p>Fleet maintenance presents unique challenges. We work with our fleet customers to select the system that best suites the needs for their application as all fleets are not the same.</p>

<p>LINK offers scalable roller brake testing and suspension play detector solutions to fleets across North America. Our performance-based brake testers are specifically designed for simple single-user operation and aim to improve safety, efficiency, and inspection quality. </p> 

<p>LINK’s roller brake testers confirm that the brake system is operational and functional, for tractor, trailer and specialty equipment. The testers ensure brakes are balanced from wheel to wheel, axle to axle and aid in diagnosing weaknesses in the braking system that otherwise might not be known. LINK’s roller brake tester and suspension play detectors can reduce periodic inspection expenses, focus repairs, improving brake and ABS diagnostics while reducing downtime.
