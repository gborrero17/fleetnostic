    <p>Transit bus maintenance presents unique challenges. We work with each agency to design the best solution for them.</p>

<p>LINK offers scalable roller brake testing and suspension play detector solutions to transit agencies across North America. Our performance-based brake testers are specifically designed for simple single-user operation and aim to improve safety, efficiency, and inspection quality. Transit agencies large or small often rely on archaic or dangerous methods of brake testing to ensure their brake system is operational. These types of tests can be dangerous and inaccurate putting drivers and technicians at risk. Panic stop testing can’t effectively be done in the rain, ice, or snow.</p>

<p>Our testers eliminate these practices and ensure that buses are operating in the best interest of your agency and community. LINK’s roller brake testers confirm that the brake system is operational and functional, the brakes are balanced from wheel to wheel, and also diagnoses weaknesses in the braking system that otherwise might not be known. LINK’s roller brake tester and suspension play detectors can reduce periodic inspection expenses, focus repairs, improving brake and ABS diagnostics and reduce downtime.
