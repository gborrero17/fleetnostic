<p>LINK Ohio’s facility was originally owned by Radlinski and Associates (RAI), founded by Dick Radlinski in 1993 to provide heavy vehicle testing in East Liberty, Ohio, at the Transportation Research Center.</p>
<p>In 2003, Link Engineering Company purchased RAI, which would later be known as LINK Ohio, and expanded its testing capability to include year-round vehicle testing as well as ISO 17025 accreditation. Operated by Link Engineering Company, the facility became the leader in the testing industry for third-party Commercial Vehicle brake testing, laboratory testing, proving ground testing, and on-highway testing.</p>
<p>In 2021, LINK Ohio officially launched it’s brand FleetScore, paving way for greater focus on the sale and distribution of our PBBT equipment that we’ve been supplying since 2003. FleetScore’s PBBT solutions serve the North American market.
